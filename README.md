# classical--ciphers
In this assignment i developed a Python application with a  graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to encrypt text using three classical  ciphers: Caesar, Vigenère, and Playfair. The cipher algorithms were implemented  in Python.

1. Caesar Cipher: The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely 
known encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the 
plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.



2. Vigenère Cipher: The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic 
text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A keyword is 
repeated to match the length of the plaintext, and each letter of the keyword 
corresponds to a shift value.


3. Playfair Cipher: The Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption 
technique and was the first literal digraph substitution cipher. It employs a 5x5 
grid containing a keyword or phrase. Each letter pair (digraph) in the plaintext 
is replaced by a corresponding digraph from the grid.
